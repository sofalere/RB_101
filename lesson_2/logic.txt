a method that returns the sum of two integers:

-define a method with two parameters
-in method body add 1st paramater to second parameter
-the method will return the evaluation

START

GET two arguments from user in method
argument1 + argument2
END


a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together:

-set array of strings
-define a method that takes one parameter
-in method body use ary * str method that takes the parameter as the ary and type ary * " "
-assign it to a new variable

START

SET a variable that is an array of strings
DEFINE a method with one parameter
SET new_string = array * " " 
RETURN new_string

END


a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

-definea an array of integers
-even though they are integers, there might be dubplicates on purspoe so use index locations for sparsing through array
-iterate through array and include only index numbers that are odd in a new_array

START
SET integer array
SET iterator = 1

ITERATE over indexes, 
  IF index % 2 != 0
  SET new_array
 
PRINT new_array
END
