PROB
Create a clock that is independent of date.

RULES
- should be able to add minutes to and subtract minutes 
    from the time represented by a given clock object
- Two clock objects that represent the same time should be 
    equal to each other

APPROACH
-
+
==
to_s

at() 1 or 2 args
- define at method to take 1 arg and then a default arg 00
- format(â€˜%02d:%02dâ€™, hours, minutes)
